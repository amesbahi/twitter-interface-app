In this application, Twitterâ€™s REST API is used to access a Twitter profile's information and render it to a user. The page automatically authenticates access to the Twitter profile. It uses this access to populate three columns on the page:

1. Your 5 most recent tweets
2. Your 5 most recent friends
3. Your 5 most recent private messages
